1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" chapter serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or function. It covers key concepts, main features, target users, and intended use, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide on including the sections of Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview in a document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platforms that include multiple core modules), it is advisable to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

Given the numerous points that a product or functional module may involve, adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Create a Unified Understanding: It can serve as an opening to provide a consistent recognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: It minimizes the time spent on repeatedly explaining the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product in succinct language, avoiding lengthiness.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling propositions and main features.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template offers a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documents. By organizing structured content and using clear expression, it helps the team better convey the functional value of the product, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

We observe some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive and need to be jointly explained based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of this module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Aside from this introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a brief description. Specifically illustrate what the intended use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a containerization management module oriented towards cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifying the application cloud migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can conveniently create Kubernetes clusters and rapidly establish an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.

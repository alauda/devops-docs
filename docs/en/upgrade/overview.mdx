# Overview

This guide provides a detailed introduction to the upgrade/migration strategy of `Alauda DevOps` in the scenario of upgrading from `Alauda Container Platform (ACP)` `v4.0` or `v4.1` to `v4.2`.

# Upgrade Scenarios

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Upgrading from ACP v4.0">

If your current `ACP` version is `v4.0`, the upgrade path for `Alauda DevOps` is as follows:

1. **Migrate to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)**

   Before upgrading ACP, verify your current DevOps operator versions:

   - If your operators do not match the [Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen) Version Matrix](#next-gen), you must perform migration by following [Migrating Alauda DevOps to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)](./migrating-devops-v3-to-v4.mdx).
   - If you have already completed migration on `ACP` `v4.0` and your operators match the [Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen) Version Matrix](#next-gen), you may skip this step and proceed directly to ACP platform upgrade.

2. **Upgrade ACP Platform**

   Upgrade the `ACP` platform to version `v4.2`. For detailed instructions, refer to <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform"  href="upgrade/overview.html" children="Upgrading Container Platform"  />.

3. **Upgrade each operator to a newer version (optional)**

   if you want to use the updated version for each Operator, you can further learn how to upgrade to the updated version in each operator's documentation, please refer to [Upgrade each operator to a newer version](#upgrade)

</Tab>

<Tab label="Upgrading from ACP v4.1">

1. **Upgrade ACP Platform**

   Before starting the upgrade of `ACP`, in `ACP` `v4.1`, the Migration `Alauda DevOps` to `Alauda DevOps (Next Gen)` should have been completed. Please confirm that the DevOps-related operator versions are consistent: [Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen) Version Matrix](#next-gen). If your operators do not match the **Version Matrix**, you must perform migration by following [Migrating Alauda DevOps to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)](./migrating-devops-v3-to-v4.mdx).

   Upgrade the `ACP` platform to version `v4.2`. For detailed instructions, refer to  <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform"  href="upgrade/overview.html" children="Upgrading Container Platform"  />

2. **Upgrade each operator to a newer version (optional)**

   if you want to use the updated version for each Operator, you can further learn how to upgrade to the updated version in each operator's documentation, please refer to [Upgrade each operator to a newer version](#upgrade).

## Ensure that Alauda DevOps has been migrated to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)

On `ACP` `v4.0` or `v4.1`, ensure that `Alauda DevOps` has already been migrated to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)`. If your Alauda DevOps–related operators are at the versions listed below, you must perform the migration first. Please refer to [Migrating Alauda DevOps to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)](./migrating-devops-v3-to-v4.mdx)

### Alauda DevOp v3.20 version matrix before migration

| Alauda DevOps Operator     | Operator Version | Tool Instance Version |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Alauda DevOps GitLab v3    | v3.20.z          | v14.0.z               |
| Alauda DevOps Nexus v3     | v3.20.z          | v3.69.z               |
| Alauda DevOps SonarQube v3 | v3.20.z          | v9.9.z                |
| Alauda DevOps Harbor v3    | v3.20.z          | v2.6.z                |
| Alauda DevOps Tekton v3    | v3.20.z          | -                     |

### Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen) version matrix after migration \{#next-gen}

| Alauda DevOps Operator                                       | Version   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Alauda DevOps Pipelines (replace `Alauda DevOps Tekton v3`) | v4.0.z    |
| Alauda Build of Gitlab                                       | v17.8.z   |
| Alauda Build of Harbor                                       | v2.12.z   |
| Alauda Build of SonarQube                                    | v2025.1.z |
| Alauda Build of Nexus                                        | v3.76.z   |

## Upgrade each operator to a newer version (optional) \{#upgrade}

You have now completed the migration from `Alauda DevOps` to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)`. In `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)`, if you want to use the updated version for each Operator, you can further learn how to upgrade to the updated version in each operator's documentation.

::: warning

**Important Restriction**

If you need to continue using the **Build** and **Release** features from **Alauda DevOps v3**, you must maintain `Alauda DevOps Pipelines` at version `v4.0.z`.

**Prohibited Actions**

**Do NOT upgrade** `Alauda DevOps Pipelines` beyond `v4.0.z` under any circumstances. Upgrading to versions above `v4.0.z` will cause irreversible compatibility issues with `katanomi`, potentially breaking existing **Build** and **Release** pipelines.

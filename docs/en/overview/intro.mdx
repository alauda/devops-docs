# Introduction

## Alauda DevOps Introduction

Alauda DevOps is a cloud native DevOps platform built on Kubernetes for quickly building and delivering cloud-native applications and workloads. From code to production, Alauda DevOps provides the complete DevOps toolchain that includes source code management, artifact and dependency management, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and source code quality control.

## Advantages

The core advantages of Alauda DevOps are as follows:

- Improved Operational Efficiency

  By automating and streamlining DevOps workflows, the platform reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and accelerates the delivery of software. Teams can focus on innovation while maintaining high-quality standards.

- Security-First Approach

  Designed with security as a cornerstone, the platform ensures end-to-end protection of sensitive data, builds, and deployments. It integrates seamlessly with enterprise security practices, including encryption, access controls, and compliance checks.

- Extensibility

  The platform is built with flexibility and customization in mind, allowing organizations to integrate a wide variety of tools, services, and platforms. With Tekton's modular and reusable components united with the safety and extensability provided by connectors, teams can easily extend pipelines to meet evolving needs.

- Unified Workflows

  Teams can centralize their DevOps processes, creating a single source of truth for builds, integrations, and deployments. This reduces complexity and fosters better collaboration between development, operations, and security teams.

- Faster Time to Market

  By automating CI/CD processes and leveraging prebuilt connectors, organizations can accelerate the delivery of high-quality applications, reducing time-to-market for new features and services.

- Advanced DevOps Practices

  Teams can adopt and refine modern DevOps strategies, such as event-driven pipelines, pipeline-as-code, and advanced monitoring, to optimize their development and delivery processes.


## Scenarios

- Platform building

  Platform teams can use Alauda DevOps to build and manage their own DevOps platform, enabling business teams to focus on application development and delivery, while maintaining high-quality standards and security.

- Streamlined CI/CD pipelines

  Teams can quickly start delivering applications with golden-path pipelines, and customize pipelines to meet their specific needs, and get real-time feedback and insights.

- Centralized automation workflows

  Creating and sharing reusable workflows and tasks, teams can increase efficiency with automated and repeatable workflows reducing errors caused by manual processes.


## Limitations

- Out-of-the-box workflows and tasks are focused on cloud-native applications and workloads, and may require extra development to support other types of applications.

- Connectors currently support `git`  and `oci` protocols with limited support for authentication methods.

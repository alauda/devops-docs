## Prerequisites

### Upgrade ACP Platform

First, upgrade the `ACP` platform to version `v4`. For detailed instructions, refer to  <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform"  href="upgrade/overview.html" children="Upgrading Container Platform"  />.

### Prepare Extension Packages

After completing the `ACP` platform upgrade, you need to separately prepare the `Alauda DevOps Operators` and upload them. For specific operation steps, refer to  <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform"  href="ui/cli_tools/#downloading-the-tool" children="Uploading Operators" />.

:::note
When downloading the DevOps extension package, you can download it in batches or individually based on the `Alauda DevOps V3 Upgrade` template in the **Customer Portal**. The relevant version of the corresponding operator needs to be consistent with the version of  [Version Compatibility Matrix](#Version).

## Upgrading Alauda DevOps

### Upgrade Operators via Migration {#Migration}

After completing the prerequisites, upgrade the following `Operators` as documented:

- [Migrating Alauda DevOps Pipelines](./migrating-tekton-v3-to-v4.mdx)
- [Migrating Alauda Build of Gitlab](https://docs.alauda.io/alauda-build-of-gitlab/17.8/upgrade/02_14_upgrade_to_17.html)
- [Migrating Alauda Build of Harbor](https://docs.alauda.io/alauda-build-of-harbor/2.12/upgrade/01_upgrade_2.6.4_to_2.12.html)
- [Migrating Alauda Build of SonarQube](https://docs.alauda.io/alauda-build-of-sonarqube/2025.1/upgrade/05_upgrade_to_2025.1.0.html)
- [Migrating Alauda Build of Nexus](https://docs.alauda.io/alauda-build-of-nexus/3.76/upgrade/migrate_to_3.76.0.html)

### Upgrading Operators via UI {#UI}

For `Alauda DevOps v3`, `Alauda DevOps Eventing v3`, and `Alauda DevOps Jenkins v3`, complete the upgrade through the UI after the `ACP` upgrade:

Navigate to `Administrator` -> `Marketplace` -> `Operator Hub`, switch to the target cluster and enter the corresponding Operator details page. Click the instance name you want to upgrade to enter the instance details page, then follow the instructions to complete the upgrade.

## Next Steps

You have now completed the upgrade of `Alauda DevOps` in the `ACP v3` to `v4` upgrade scenario. However, the `Operators` upgraded via [Upgrade via Migration](#Migration) may not be the latest available versions. You can contact technical support to obtain the latest Operators and continue upgrading to the latest version using the [Upgrading Instances via UI](#UI) method.

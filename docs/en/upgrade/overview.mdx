# Overview

When upgrading `Alauda Container Platform (ACP)` to `v4.1`, the upgrade strategy for `Alauda DevOps` depends on your current platform version. In all scenarios, migration to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)` is **mandatory** to ensure platform **security**, **maintainability**, and compatibility with `ACP v4.1`.

# Upgrade Scenarios

<Tab label="Upgrading from ACP v3.18">

If your current ACP version is `v3.18` , the `Alauda DevOps` upgrade path includes **two required steps**:

1. **Upgrade `Alauda DevOps` to v3.20**  
   This version ensures compatibility with `ACP v4.1` and serves as the foundation for migration.

2. **Migrate `Alauda DevOps` to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)**  
   Migration to the next-generation architecture is required to maintain platform security and long-term support.

<Tab label="Upgrading from ACP v4.0">

If your current ACP version is `v4.0`, verify that `Alauda DevOps` has already been upgraded to **v3.20** before proceeding.  
After confirming the version, you must **migrate to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)`** to align with `ACP v4.1` requirements.

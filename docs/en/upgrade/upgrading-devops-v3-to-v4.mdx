## Prerequisites

You have two options for preparing the upgrade package:

1. **Combined Package**: Merge the `ACP` core package with the `DevOps` extension package. To obtain the extension package, you can download `Alauda DevOps Operators` in bulk or as needed through the **Customer Portal**. For detailed instructions on obtaining the installation package, refer to <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform" href="install/prepare/download.html" children="Downloading Operators" />.
2. **Separate Packages**: If you choose not to combine the packages, prepare `Alauda DevOps Operators` separately and manually upload them after completing the `ACP` platform upgrade. For specific instructions, refer to <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform" href="ui/cli_tools/#downloading-the-tool" children="Uploading Operators" />.
:::note
When downloading the `DevOps` extension package, it is recommended to select the `Alauda DevOps V3 Upgrade` batch download template in the **Customer Portal**. With this template, you can quickly obtain the upgrade package and improve download efficiency.

**Upgrading ACP**

Upgrade the `ACP` platform to version `v4`. For detailed instructions, refer to <ExternalSiteLink name="container_platform" href="upgrade/overview.html" children="Upgrading Container Platform" />.

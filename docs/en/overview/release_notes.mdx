## Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen) - 4.0

Connectors provide a secure and efficient way to connect to external services and tools and provide an unobtrusive way to integrate with them. Platform teams can easily and securely create connectors while keeping access secrets protected.

#### DevOps Toolchain

Provides a easy deployable DevOps toolchain instances with a set of deployment templates to increase deployment speed and confidence while keeping full customizability. Includes:

- Alauda Build of Gitlab v17.8
- Alauda Build of Harbor v2.12

A complete step-by-step migration guide from previous DevOps legacy toolchain is provided within the addon's documentation.

#### Release Pipelines Template parameters

Users can specify parameter values in a pipeline template design to be provided when executing the pipeline instead of having to create and assign parameters when creating a pipeline based of the template. This change empowers platform builders to create more flexible and reusable pipeline templates and improves overall speed of pipeline creation.

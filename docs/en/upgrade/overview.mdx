# Overview

When upgrading `Alauda Container Platform (ACP)` from `v3.16` or `v3.18` to `v4.0`, the upgrade of `Alauda DevOps` involves two major steps:

1. **Upgrading `Alauda DevOps` to v3.20**  
2. **Migrating `Alauda DevOps` to Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)**

These two steps together form the complete upgrade and migration path for `Alauda DevOps`.


# Recommended Upgrade Path

Before migration, it is mandatory to upgrade `Alauda DevOps` to **v3.20**. This version ensures full compatibility with `ACP v4.0` and provides the necessary foundation for migration to the `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)`.

After upgrading to `v3.20`, you may choose whether to proceed with the migration:

- **Migration is optional**, and existing `Alauda DevOps v3.20` can continue running on `ACP v4.0` without issues.  

- However, it is strongly recommended to migrate to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)` for the following reasons:  

  - `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)` provides enhanced **security**, improved **maintainability**, and overall platform robustness.  
  - Starting from **ACP v4.1**, the following `Alauda DevOps v3` Operators will **no longer be maintained**:

  | Operator                   |
  | -------------------------- |
  | Alauda DevOps Tekton v3    |
  | Alauda DevOps GitLab v3    |
  | Alauda DevOps Harbor v3    |
  | Alauda DevOps SonarQube v3 |
  | Alauda DevOps Nexus v3     |

# Summary

| Step | Description | Required |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Upgrade to v3.20 | Upgrade `Alauda DevOps` to version `v3.20` to ensure compatibility with `ACP v4.0` |  Yes |
| Migrate to Next-Gen | Migration to `Alauda DevOps (Next-Gen)` to Improve Security Capability and Maintainability |  Optional (Recommended) |
